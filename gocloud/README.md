# gocloud - An Oh-My-Zsh Plugin

A simple command to change directory into your iCloud folder.

## Usage

Just type `gocloud [folder]`

The command will change into your iCloud folder or into any folder you specify
that exists inside it.

This command works relative to your iCloud folder, not your current directory. If you already are into your iCloud folder just use the normal `cd` command.

## Why I made this plugin

This command was initially an alias to avoid typing the long path of iCloud folder, but I wanted it to support command completion. I was also curious about how oh-my-zsh command completion works and decided this was a good candidate for my first oh-my-zsh plugin.
